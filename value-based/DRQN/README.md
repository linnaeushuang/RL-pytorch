## note
only replacing the first non-convolutional fully connected layer with an LSTM layer(LSTM replaces IP1), see appendix A in original paper


there are two versions of DRQN:random update and sequential update,

but DRQN doesn't show the phenomenon of training,even if loss is not 0.

fix the bug,later
